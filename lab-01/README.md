# Lab 01 - Minikube

For these labs we will use [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) as our Kubernetes environment. This is
going to run locally on a virtual machine on your laptop.

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a 
single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to 
try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

## Task 0: Installing VirtualBox

By default `Minikube` uses `VirtualBox` to run its VM.  To install VirtualBox 
download the latest [package](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.16/VirtualBox-6.1.16-140961-OSX.dmg) 
and install it.

## Task 1: Installing Minikube

The easiest way to install Minikube is by using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). The 
following command will install Minikube.

```
brew install minikube

```

## Task 2: Confirming minikube installation

To verify that the installation is succesfull we can try to get the version of
Minikube with the following command :

```
minikube version

---

minikube version: v1.4.0
commit: 7969c25a98a018b94ea87d949350f3271e9d64b6
```

## Task 3: Running Minikube

To start Minikube run the `minikube start` command (it might take a couple of 
minutes before Minikube has started):

```
minikube start

## Task 4: Checking Minikube status

To verify that minikube is running correctly run the `minikube status` command:

```
minikube status

---

host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.99.106
